1.Data Loading and Inspection:
                   -Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
                   -Checked the basic information about the dataset, including data types and missing values.

2.Data Cleaning:
                   -Identified and addressed missing values in the "RM" feature using the mean value.
                    Checked for duplicates and removed them.

                   -Explored the distribution of the "CHAS" variable and its imbalance.

3.Statistical Testing:
                   -Conducted a T-test to test the significance of the "CHAS" variable in predicting property prices.
                   
                    -Formulated hypotheses and used a threshold level of 0.05 for significance.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
                   -Visualized the distribution of different features using histograms.

                   -Calculated and examined the correlation matrix, focusing on the correlation with the target variable "MEDV."

                   -Created scatter plots to visualize the relationships between "MEDV," "RM," "LSTAT," and "PTRATIO."

5.Data Splitting:

                   -Used Stratified Shuffle Split to maintain the ratio of values in the "CHAS" variable during train-test splitting.
                    Split the data into training and testing sets.

6.Model Training:
                   -Utilized Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor for model training.
                   
                   -Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RSME).

7.Cross-Validation:
                   -Applied cross-validation to assess the Random Forest Regressor's performance.
                   
                   -Calculated the mean and standard deviation of RSME scores.

8.Model Saving and Loading:

                   -Used joblib to save and load the trained Random Forest Regressor model.

9.Model Prediction:
                   -Used the trained model to predict values on the test set.

                   -Compared predicted values with the actual values from the test set.
