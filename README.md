Dragon Real Estate Price Prediction is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting real estate prices using a dataset of various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and more. The project employs regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, to make accurate predictions.

**Key Features Data Exploration:**
In-depth analysis of the dataset, handling missing values, and exploring correlations between variables.  Statistical Testing: Significance testing using T-tests to understand the impact of features, such as proximity to the Charles River, on property prices. 
**Model Training:**
Utilizing machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor, to train on historical data.  Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques to evaluate and compare the performance of different regression models. 
**Model Persistence:**
Saving the trained Random Forest Regressor model using the joblib library for future use. 
**Interactive Predictions:**
A sample interactive interface using Tkinter for predicting real estate prices with a saved model. 
**How to Use Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is available in the data.csv file.  Colab Notebooks: Explore the project's development process and analysis through the colab notebooks provided. 
**Model Training:** Understand the model training process by going through the training scripts. 
**Predictions:**
Use the saved Random Forest Regressor model to make predictions in real-time 
**Dependencies**
Python 3.x, Google colab Notebooks, Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
